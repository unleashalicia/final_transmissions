                        Only ghost hunt if the weather permits. Low light and poor weather conditions can distort the cards, which are necessary to unlock spirits.
                        Always be aware of surrounding dangers when interacting with the game.

                    <h3>Make sure your ghost meter is ready</h4>
                        <p>
                            No great ghost hunter allows their equipment to fail in the middle of a supernatural encounter. To ensure that you’re ready to meet some ghosts, check that your meter (phone) is equipped with the following specifications:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Running Android (Ghosts have trouble with iOS)</li>
                                <li>Access to your phone’s camera</li>
                                <li>An up-to-date version of Chrome or Firefox</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Have your card deck with you</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can print your first card deck for free at [link] or purchase an official card deck at [link]

                        <p>

                        </p>
                    <h3>Only ghost hunt if the weather permits</h3>
                        <p>
                            While typical ghosts tend to lurk around in the darkness, our ghosts prefer nicer weather. Search for stories and encounters during daylight (non-eclipse) hours, preferably outdoors in areas without wind, rain, snow, or otherwise inclement weather.
                        </p>
                    <h3>To fully immerse yourself in our stories, we highly recommend using headphones while searching for and experiencing encounters.</h3>
                    <h3>Join an experience at your own risk!  </h3>
                        <p>
                            If you’re wearing headphones and looking at your phone, be sure to also look out for traffic, be wary of where you’re walking, and every other safety precaution.  We don’t need another ghost in this app.
