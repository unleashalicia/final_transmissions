                    Only ghost hunt if the weather permits. Low light and poor weather conditions can distort the cards, which are necessary to unlock spirits.
                    Always be aware of surrounding dangers when interacting with the game.

                    To locate your spirit, flip the switch on the ghost finder.

                    The knob has three ranges; long, mid and close. You can turn ('click') the knob to help gauge the meter. Continue to adjust the knob based on proximity to the spirit.

                    Once you're in the experience you'll see the meter. The meter is displayed in portrait mode only.

                    Use the meter to guide you towards your next location.
                    As you approach the spirit, you will begin to hear music.
                    When your narrator begins to speak, stop and listen.

                    Once you are guided to your spirit, your phone will switch to camera mode. Augmented reality will display in landscape mode only.

                    The narrator will notify you when to use a card.
                    Place your marker on a flat surface on the ground protected from wind.
                    Using a card skips forward to the next event.
